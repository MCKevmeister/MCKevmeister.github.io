I"R<p>The class today involved a discusson of the following questions.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Is there adifference between ‘knowing’ something and ‘having knowledge’ of something?</li>
  <li>What is ‘truth’?</li>
  <li>What do we really mean when we say something is ‘true’?</li>
  <li>Is there a difference between knowing something is ‘true’ and believing that something is ‘true’?</li>
  <li>What is the difference between subjective and objective ‘truth’?</li>
  <li>What is a ‘fact’ and can ‘facts’ change?</li>
  <li>How do we discover if something is ‘true’ or not?</li>
  <li>“We do not see things as they are but as we are” Anais Nin. What does this mean?</li>
  <li>“Reality is an illusion, albeit a very persistent one” (Einstein) What does this mean?</li>
  <li>Is there a difference between ‘true’ and ‘valid’? Explain!</li>
</ol>

<p>Some of the questions had simpler answers, others seemed to cause a fair amount of discussion between the members of the class, other seemed entierly unanswerable. I feel that there is no better quote to descirbe what occured during those moments than the quote from St. Augustine “What then is time? If no one asks me, I know what it is. If I wish to explain it to him who asks, I do not know.”</p>

<p>It was pointed out that the real crux to answering these questions gets to Ontology and Epistemology, which I must admit are words that I have heard spoken before but have not researched. So I shall set out to understand their meaning.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-ontology-how-is-it-relevant-to-research">What is ontology? How is it relevant to research?</h2>

<p>The very simple answer to this question can be described as “What is reality?”. Answering the quetion, kinda hard. But asking it - Ontology.</p>

<p>The longer answer, well its a bit more complex. Ontology is a branch of meta-physics or philisophy that studies reality or what there is. Beyond that, and I am going to be totally naieve, I think most of the answers that I could find start to go into the world of the woo. There really isn’t a great way to answer the question, nor is it really an interesting area of study, mostly because you could say that it is and therefore to my ontology it is because it is because it is. Honeslty, it seems a tad rediclious 
What reality is real and what is not?</p>

<h2 id="what-is-epistemology-how-is-it-relevant-to-research">What is epistemology? How is it relevant to research?</h2>

<p>What kind of knowledge</p>

<h2 id="what-is-the-connection-between-ontology-and-epistemology-in-a-research-context">What is the connection between ontology and epistemology in a research context?</h2>
