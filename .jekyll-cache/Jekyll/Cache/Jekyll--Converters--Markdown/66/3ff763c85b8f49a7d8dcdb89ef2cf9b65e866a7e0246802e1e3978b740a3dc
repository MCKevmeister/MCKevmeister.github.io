I"?<p>The class today involved a discusson of the following questions.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Is there adifference between ‘knowing’ something and ‘having knowledge’ of something?</li>
  <li>What is ‘truth’?</li>
  <li>What do we really mean when we say something is ‘true’?</li>
  <li>Is there a difference between knowing something is ‘true’ and believing that something is ‘true’?</li>
  <li>What is the difference between subjective and objective ‘truth’?</li>
  <li>What is a ‘fact’ and can ‘facts’ change?</li>
  <li>How do we discover if something is ‘true’ or not?</li>
  <li>“We do not see things as they are but as we are” Anais Nin. What does this mean?</li>
  <li>“Reality is an illusion, albeit a very persistent one” (Einstein) What does this mean?</li>
  <li>Is there a difference between ‘true’ and ‘valid’? Explain!</li>
</ol>

<p>Some of the questions had simpler answers, others seemed to cause a fair amount of discussion between the members of the class, other seemed entierly unanswerable. I feel that there is no better quote to descirbe what occured during those moments than the quote from St. Augustine “What then is time? If no one asks me, I know what it is. If I wish to explain it to him who asks, I do not know.”</p>

<p>It was pointed out that the real crux to answering these questions gets to Ontology and Epistemology, which I must admit are words that I have heard spoken before but have not researched. So I shall set out to understand their meaning.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-ontology-how-is-it-relevant-to-research">What is ontology? How is it relevant to research?</h2>

<p>The very simple answer to this question can be described as “What is reality?”. Answering the quetion, kinda hard. But asking it - Ontology.</p>

<p>The longer answer, well its a bit more complex. Ontology is a branch of meta-physics or philisophy that studies reality or what there is. There are 2 major positions of ontology; realism and nominalism which contrast one another.</p>

<p>In realism, a reasearher sees the world as spearted from the interperations that humans have of it, or being independent of the mind. In Nominalism a researcher sees the world through their interperations and subjectiveity.</p>

<p>I am going to be totally honest, I think most of the answers that I could find are entierly rediclious. There really isn’t a great way to answer the question, nor is it really an interesting area of study in my opnion, mostly because I could say that something is and therefore to my ontology it is because it is because it is. Honeslty, it seems a tad rediclious. Circular logic to prove the something is seems entierly flawed, based soley on belif that it is. While I think that there is some value in letting the mind ponder on theroetical questoins, I do not think that in the world of information and numbers where things are measuarble and definable it is useful at all. It does seem to serve a purpose in trying to encapsulate the etheral, emotions and interpersonal relationships for example. Now, I do admit that I have a bias towards the former probabley due to due to my lack of being able to form deep and meaningful interpersonal relationships.</p>

<p>I think that knowing that there are different ways in which people can view the world can be useful to understand how they</p>
