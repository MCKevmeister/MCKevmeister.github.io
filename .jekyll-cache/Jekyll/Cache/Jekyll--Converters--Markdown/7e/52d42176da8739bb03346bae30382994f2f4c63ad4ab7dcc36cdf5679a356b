<p>‚ÄúA puzzle is a set of cirumstances in which there is no ambiguity whatsoever once some thought has been given to what is happening or needs to be done‚Äù.</p>

<p>The ‚Äúmagic roundabout‚Äù located in Swinden is a great example of self-emergent systems. The roundabout is not a single roundabout, but rather 5 roundabouts surrounding a central roundabout that goes the wrong way. By following the basic road rules (give way to the right/left and indicate, as well as looking at other drivers in the eyes to see if you can understand thier intention), a commuter is able to easily navigate towards their intended destination. The following videos show how the roundabout works, and how self emergent behaviour solves the problem of several roads intersecting with one another.</p>

<p>Expanding on this, the following video looks at specifically how the different ways that a commuter could choose to navigate through the ‚Äòmagic roundabout‚Äô given differing traffic volume conditions.</p>
