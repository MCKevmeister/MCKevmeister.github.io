<p>The class today initially discussed self-emergent systems, as well as the idea from Daniel Pink of Autonomy Mastery and Purpose from his book Drive. The theme connecting these 2 ideas is of course self-emergent systems.</p>

<p>One of the class videos showed and demonstrated how self-emergent systems in traffic flow produce higher flow of traffic though an intersection.</p>

<p>Located in Swinden England, the Magic Roundabout is a great example of self-emergent systems. The roundabout is not a single roundabout, but rather 5 roundabouts surrounding a central roundabout that goes the wrong way. By following the basic road rules (give way to the right/left and indicate, as well as looking at other drivers in the eyes to see if you can understand thier intention), a commuter is able to easily navigate towards their intended destination. The following videos show how the roundabout works, and how self-emergent behaviour solves the problem of several roads intersecting with one another.</p>

<p>Expanding on this, the following video looks at specifically how the different ways that a commuter could choose to navigate through the ‘magic roundabout’ given differing traffic volume conditions (0:30 - 0:57).</p>

<p>“A puzzle is a set of circumstances in which there is no ambiguity whatsoever once some thought has been given to what is happening or needs to be done. The issues that need to be faced are entirely clear, the
range of options is completely known and there exists a single correct solution
to the puzzle”.</p>
