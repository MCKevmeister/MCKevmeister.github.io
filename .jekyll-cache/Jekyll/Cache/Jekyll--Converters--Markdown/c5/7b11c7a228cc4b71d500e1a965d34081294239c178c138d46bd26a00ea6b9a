<p>Cain &amp; Abel is freeware composed of 2 applications: Cain and Abel.</p>

<h3 id="cain">Cain</h3>

<p>Cain is used for password extraction and recovery.</p>

<h3 id="abel">Abel</h3>

<p>Abel runs a Windows NT service with protects passwords that are transmitted over the local network.</p>

<p>Itâ€™s other primary features are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Cracking encrypted Passwords</li>
  <li>Preforming dictionary attacks</li>
  <li>Preforming brute force attacks</li>
  <li>ARP spoofing</li>
  <li>Calculating Hashes
    <ul>
      <li>LM</li>
      <li>NTLM</li>
      <li>MD5</li>
      <li>SHA-1</li>
      <li>SHA-2</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>There are many tutorials online, here is a tutorial video similar to the work that we have done inside Practice Labs.

Additionally, there are a bunch of videos on youtube that show the full functionality can be learnt about.

<h2 id="comparison-of-password-attacks">Comparison of Password Attacks</h2>
<p>Brute forcing is not the only way in which a threat agent can attack through. Other ways include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Traffic Interception</li>
  <li>Man-in-the-middle</li>
  <li>Key logging</li>
  <li>Social Engineering (Phishing, Shoulder surfing, baiting)
So how does brute forcing compare to each of these.
There is no interception of traffic, rather everything is done client side so in comparison to those methods that require physical access to devices, it is far easier.
Key-logging requires getting either software or hardware into the targets computer. This is both difficult and
In comparison, simple shoulder surfing to get a password can be as if not more effective.</li>
</ul>
