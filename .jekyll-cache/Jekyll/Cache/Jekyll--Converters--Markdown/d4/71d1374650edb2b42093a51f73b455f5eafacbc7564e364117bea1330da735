<p>The class today initially discussed self-emergent systems, as well as the idea from Daniel Pink of Autonomy Mastery and Purpose from his book Drive. The theme connecting these 2 ideas is of course self-emergent systems.</p>

<p>One of the class videos showed and demonstrated how self-emergent systems in traffic flow produce higher flow of traffic though an intersection.</p>

<p>Located in Swinden England, the Magic Roundabout is a great example of self-emergent systems. The roundabout is not a single roundabout, but rather 5 roundabouts surrounding a central roundabout that goes the wrong way. By following the basic road rules (give way to the right/left and indicate, as well as looking at other drivers in the eyes to see if you can understand thier intention), a commuter is able to easily navigate towards their intended destination. The following videos show how the roundabout works, and how self-emergent behaviour solves the problem of several roads intersecting with one another.</p>

<p>Expanding on this, the following video looks at specifically how the different ways that a commuter could choose to navigate through the ‘magic roundabout’ given differing traffic volume conditions (in particular 0:30 - 0:57).</p>

<p>“A puzzle is a set of circumstances in which there is no ambiguity whatsoever once some thought has been given to what is happening or needs to be done”.</p>
