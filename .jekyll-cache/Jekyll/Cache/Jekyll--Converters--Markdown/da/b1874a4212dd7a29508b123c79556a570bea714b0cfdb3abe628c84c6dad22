    <p>Is there adifference between â€˜knowingâ€™ something and â€˜having knowledgeâ€™ of something?</p>

    <p>I know of astro physics, but I do not know how to do astro physics. I am aweare the equation â€œE=MC2â€ but to solve that equation or put it into another context then I would be unsure.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What is â€˜truthâ€™?</p>

    <p>The opposite of â€˜falseâ€™. It seems like it should be what is real, but it somehow isnâ€™. It seems like it comes to individual belief.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What do we really mean when we say something is â€˜trueâ€™?</p>

    <p>That itâ€™s â€œlegitâ€. To the person who is claiming it is true, it is.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Is there a difference between knowing something is â€˜trueâ€™ and believing that something is â€˜trueâ€™?</li>
  <li>What is the difference between subjective and objective â€˜truthâ€™?</li>
  <li>What is a â€˜factâ€™ and can â€˜factsâ€™ change ?</li>
  <li>How do we discover if something is â€˜trueâ€™ or not?</li>
  <li>â€œWe do not see things as they are but as we areâ€ Anais Nin. What does this mean?</li>
  <li>â€œReality is an illusion, albeit a very persistent oneâ€ (Einstein) What does this mean?</li>
  <li>Is there a difference between â€˜trueâ€™ and â€˜validâ€™? Explain!</li>
