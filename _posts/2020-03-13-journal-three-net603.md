<h2>JOURNAL #THREE [NET603]</h2>

<h2>USER GROUPS</h2>

<h3>Understanding business users profiles</h3>

The proposed network must support the users in achieving their goals and supporting the organisation in providing a competitive service to its customers. In order to properly understand the needs the context of the users work needs to be determined.

There are two requirements we must understand:

- The functional requirements which tell us what the system must do

- The non-functional requirements which places constraints on the system

<b>Steps taken to determine requirements:</b>

1. Identifying the business users

2. Establishing users needs 

3. Categorizing requirements

The above analysis makes the assumption that laptops will be provided to all employees. This offers flexibility in terms of:

- Portability 

- Hot desking

- Remote working

- Flexible work options

- Collaborative working 

- Presentations and meetings

- Run off batteries

- Reduce desktop clutter and wires

- Can be transformed into a desktop 

The most likely choice for the operating system will be Microsoft Server 2019. The chosen office package in the above chart is listed as Microsoft Office 365, there are 5 key reasons why this will be recommended to the business:

1. Familiarity: Despite the many alternatives Office is the most familiar to employees and organisations due to the massive investment carried out by Microsoft, it has become the default choice.

2. Suitability: Office integrates well with other Microsoft products in a way that some of the competitor offerings can't. 

3. Offering: Office provides everything employees need in order to carry out their work effectively and allows teams to work together towards common goals. 

4. Cloud: Office provides cloud-based access which is essential for management and those travel agents that will be spending time on the road.

5. Sharing: Office is optimised for content sharing on the businesses intranet, for instant communication and collaboration.
