As part of this lab we have been tasked with desiging a network. The network inlcudes

- Windows 2019 Web Server Public/Private IP 103.28.250.99/10.0.0.1
  - Roles and Features
    - SMTP
- Linux Database Server Private IP 10.0.0.2
  - Software
    - MariaDB

Both servers site in the same virtual security group.

The network design best for this type of network would be

Investigate and discuss the configuration required on a firewall for a web server providing
HTTP and HTTPS
FTP over TLS/SSL
SMTP for sending emails from the websites
Remote Administration
Investigate and discuss the configuration required on a firewall for a database server providing
MariaDB
Remote Administration

Include in your discussion the IP ranges, ports and incoming and outgoing rules to enable the above configuration.

## Windows Server 2019

The following are instructions that are for the set up of windows 2019 server using powershell scripts.

### Set static IP for Server

1. Run Powershell with Administrator Privilages
   ![Powershell Admin](https://mckevmeister.github.io/assets/images/powershellAdmin.png)

2. Check for the correct network interface index

```powershell
  PS C:\Users\Administrator> Get-NetIPInterface -AddressFamily IPv4

```

3. Set Static IP 10.0.0.1 and Gateway 10.0.0.3 as per network requirements

   ```poswershell
   PS C:\Users\Administrator> New-NetIPAddress -InterfaceIndex 6 -AddressFamily IPv4 -IPAddress "10.0.0.01" -PrefixLength 24 -DefaultGateway "10.0.0.3"
   ```

### Allow ICMP Echo Reply though Powershell

Windows firewall by default will block all ping requests. To allow this to occur follow these steps

1. Run Powershell with Administrator Privilages
   ![Powershell Admin](https://mckevmeister.github.io/assets/images/AllowICMP.png)
2. Run the following PS script

   ```powershell
   # allow ICMPv4
   PS C:\Users\Administrator> New-NetFirewallRule `
   -Name 'ICMPv4' `
   -DisplayName 'ICMPv4' `
   -Description 'Allow ICMPv4' `
   -Profile Any `
   -Direction Inbound `
   -Action Allow `
   -Protocol ICMPv4 `
   -Program Any `
   -LocalAddress Any `
   -RemoteAddress Any
   ```

3. Confirm that the script ran sucessfully

   ```powershell
   # confirm setting
   PS C:\Users\Administrator> Get-NetFirewallRule | Where-Object Name -Like 'ICMPv4'
   ```

This will produce a detialed description of the rule that has just been set up using powershell.

### Remote access to the server

Remoting into the server can be done on any windows 10 machine following these steps

1. Running "mstsc"
   ![Running mstsc](https://mckevmeister.github.io/assets/images/remoteDesktop1.png)

2. Input the hostname or IP of the computer to connect to and administrator credentials of the remote machine

## Ubuntu 20.04 Focal Fossa

Commands for ubuntu are written as though the user is using the root account. If the user is not using the root account add `Bash Sudo `

## Static IP

After basic install of ubuntu as well as creation of the root account has been completed, static IP can be set for Ubuntu

```Bash
 root@dlp:~# vi /etc/netplan/01-netcfg.yaml
# create new

network:
  ethernets:
    # interface name
    enp1s0:
      dhcp4: no
      # IP address/subnet mask
      addresses: [10.0.0.2/24]
      # default gateway
      gateway4: 10.0.1.1
      nameservers:
        # name server to bind
        addresses: [10.0.0.1]
      dhcp6: no
  version: 2

# apply settings

root@dlp:~# netplan apply
root@dlp:~# ip addr
```

There will be a print out in the terminal that will have all the ip settings of the addaptors on the ubuntu machine.

### MariaDB

#### Installing MariaDB

1. Run the following command from the terminal

   ```Bash
   root@www:~# apt -y install mariadb-server
   root@www:~# mysql_secure_installation
   ```

This will start the mysql installer. It will ask a series of start up questions for administrator account creation as well as allowing remote login.

From there Maria DB can be run by executing the following command

```Bash
root@www:~# mysql
```

My sql will now be open from the command line. From there databases can be interaccted with via the terminal. Create, insert, update and delete statements can all be executed to interact with databases that mariadb manages.

```Bash
MariaDB [(none)]> create database test_database;
MariaDB [(none)]> create table test_database.test_table (id int, name varchar(50), address varchar(50), primary key (id));
MariaDB [(none)]> insert into test_database.test_table(id, name, address) values("001", "Ubuntu", "Hiroshima");
MariaDB [(none)]> select * from test_database.test_table;
MariaDB [(none)]> drop database test_database;
```

To quit out from MariaDB execute the following

```Bash
MariaDB [(none)]> exit
```

## Firewall rules

### pfSense

pfSense is a free open source firewall operating system. It is highly extensible with packages that can be downloaded to extend the base functionality including

- DHCP server
- DNS server
- IPsec VPN end point
- Captive Portal for internet access

pfSense when installed on hardware, it can be managed via the webGUI.

### Adding firewall rules to pfSense

In webGUI, firewall rules can be added and edited from Status > System Logs, Firewall tab. There are 2 types of rules that can be created

1. Blocking Rule
2. Passing Rule

In addition to the webGUI,there is a command line programme called easyrole that manages the creation of firewall rules.

```Shell
: easyrule
usage:
Blocking only requires an IP to block
    easyrule block <interface> <source IP>

Passing requires more detail, as it must be as specific as possible. The destination port is
optional if you're using a protocol without a port (e.g. ICMP, OSPF, etc).
    easyrule pass <interface> <protocol> <source IP> <destination ip> [destination port]

Block example:
    easyrule block wan 1.2.3.4

Pass example (protocol with port):
    easyrule pass wan tcp 1.2.3.4 192.168.0.4 80

Pass example (protocol without port):
    easyrule pass wan icmp 1.2.3.4 192.168.0.4
```

### Network Diagram

Below is a logical network diagram that includes some information about the ports on what interfaces would be allowed and the firewall rules that would be set up on pfSense.
