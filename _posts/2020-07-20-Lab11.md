Windows 2019 Web Server Public/Private IP 103.28.250.99/10.0.0.1
Linux Database Server Private IP 10.0.0.2

Both servers site in the same virtual security group.

    Investigate and discuss the configuration required on a firewall for a web server providing
        HTTP and HTTPS
        FTP over TLS/SSL
        SMTP for sending emails from the websites
        Remote Administration
    Investigate and discuss the configuration required on a firewall for a database server providing
        MariaDB
        Remote Administration

Include in your discussion the IP ranges, ports and incoming and outgoing rules to enable the above configuration.

## Set static IP for Server

1. Run Powershell with Administrator Privilages
   ![Powershell Admin](https://mckevmeister.github.io/assets/images/AllowICMP.png)

## Allow ICMP Echo Reply though Powershell

Windows firewall by default will block all ping requests. To allow this to occur follow these steps

1. Run Powershell with Administrator Privilages
   ![Powershell Admin](https://mckevmeister.github.io/assets/images/AllowICMP.png)
2. Run the following PS script

   ```powershell
   # allow ICMPv4
   PS C:\Users\Administrator> New-NetFirewallRule `
   -Name 'ICMPv4' `
   -DisplayName 'ICMPv4' `
   -Description 'Allow ICMPv4' `
   -Profile Any `
   -Direction Inbound `
   -Action Allow `
   -Protocol ICMPv4 `
   -Program Any `
   -LocalAddress Any `
   -RemoteAddress Any
   ```

3. Confirm that the script ran sucessfully

   ```powershell
   # confirm setting
   PS C:\Users\Administrator> Get-NetFirewallRule | Where-Object Name -Like 'ICMPv4'
   ```

This will produce a detialed description of the rule that has just been set up using powershell.
