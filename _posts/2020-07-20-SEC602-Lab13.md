You will investigate:

    Installing a Network Policy Server
    Configuring a VPN Server and Client
    Viewing NPS Logs

Follow the instructions carefully. I missed a step the first time I completed the lab and could not connect.  On the second try, I realised I had missed a step and was able to complete the lab successfully.

For your journal and complete the lab and discuss the three the security features implemented

    The authentication method used  
    The security policy that was created 
    The accounting method used (i.e Logs)
