## MD5

Message Digest 5 (MD5) is a cryptographic hashing algorithim. It was orignally created in 1991 to replace the then current MD4 hash algorithim. Its funciton is to take a string of arbitary length and reduce it to a 32 character hexidecimal or 128 bit string.

A hash function has 3 primary requirements:

1. The function must be fast enough to read and hash a string (or file) in seconds, but not so fast that it can be easily broken

2. If one bit is changed or flipped (switching a binary 1 to 0 or vice versa) then the entire hash should be completly different (Known as the [Avalanche effect](https://tabroot.com/avalanche-effect/))

3. Output hashes should be collision resistant, meaning that 2 different files should have different hashes.

## Breaking MD5

In 2004, Xiaoyun Wang and Hongbo Yu of Shandong University released a [paper](http://merlot.usc.edu/csac-f06/papers/Wang05a.pdf) detailing the fundamental mathmatical weaknesses of MD5 and proof that the algoritim was not collision resistant.

In spite of this vulnerability, as late as 2019 major CMS providers including Wordpress where still [using MD5 to hash passwords of their users](https://www.zdnet.com/article/a-quarter-of-major-cmss-use-outdated-md5-as-the-default-password-hashing-scheme/).

## Uses of MD5

Due to the collisions of MD5, it is no longer used for cryptographic reasons but is instead used to confirm the contents of a file from a source such as a website. Below is an example of an MD5 hash being shown on a download page on CISCO's website. The user can hash the downloaded exe file and check to see if the hash of the file that they have downloaded is the same as the website. If it is not, then the file may have been changed or modified.

There are limitations to the MD5 checksums. If an attacker is able to get on to the website and alter the content of the files to inlcude malicious code, then it is trivial to then also change the checksum of the file to that of the new file.

To show the function of MD5, I created a simple .txt file and saved it to the desktop.

Following the [MD5 Powershell documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.utility/get-filehash?view=powershell-7), I created an MD5 hash of the file using the powershell cmdlet

```powershell
Get-FileHash <filepath> -Algorithm MD5
```

![MD5](/assets/images/md5-1.png)

The resulting hash of the file was: E2402BAFBF43CF4A31725EB7E70C10DB

Next I changed just the last character of the text from 5 to 4.

Then ran the same cmdlet in powershell.

The resulting hash: 1ABFCE9F58FA4C96708FEC822015084D

Changing 1 character resulted in an entierly different hash output as could be expected from the avalance effect.
