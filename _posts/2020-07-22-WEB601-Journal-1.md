# Journal 1: Hello WEB601!!!

This blog will follow my learning journey in WEB601. For this course I need to develop a dynamic website using [reactjs](https://reactjs.org/) and [redux](https://redux.js.org/), running on "JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine" [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/).

Todays class was an introduction to the material that we will be covering over the semester.

These blogs will aim to answer several key questions. These questions break down to What, Why and How.

## What?

- What have I learned?
- What do I know now that I didn't know before?
- What new undertanding/skills have I gained?
- What was the point of learning this?
- What are the real life/work applications?
- What will I do to remember this learning?
- What will I do to fill in any gaps in my undertaking?

## Why?

- Why have I learned this?

## How?

- How have I learned this?

I have written my proposal for the website that I intend to build for WEB601.

The following presentation was made during the class. It covers the couse contents.
