## Hello SDV602!!!

This will be the blog that I will use to document my learning and understanding for this course.

I am going to be following a tutorial first called [run bunny run](http://rabidgremlin.com/runbunnyrun/).

First, I have installed the most recent version of [unity](https://unity.com/). Unity first open's up into what is called the "unity hub". It acts as the home screen for unity projects, similar to that of microsoft word, visio or excel.

## Setting up the environment

Since my laptop does not have a lot of system resouces, I've adjusted the primary code editor from Visual Studio to VS code. To accomidate the development in unity, I have installed a few extensions in VS code as per the [documentation](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/other/unity).

The first few videos in the series, I've started to become familiar with the user interface that unity offers. The different windows can be moved around as needed in the development envorinment. This mimics other IDE's that show different interfaces. Sometimes the hierchary will be important, other times the different views of the current secene might be needed to gain perspective on the development environment.

## Version Control

Following the 4th video in the series, I have established source control using Github. The repository for this code is avaiable [here](https://github.com/MCKevmeister/BunnyRunTutorial).

I am already somewhat comforatble with using Github desktop as a git client. What is interesting to note, is that the GUI has changed since the time of the original videos. This highlights the fact that it might be better to learn the console commands associated with git as the GUI is subject to change.

# Unity Editor

At the time of writing, I have completed 4 1/2 videos of the [Run Bunny Run](http://www.rabidgremlin.com/runbunnyrun) series. The above screenshot shows the unity editor. The scene I am working on has a few sprites (the bunny and cactus) as well as the ground asset. All of these elements have a rigid body and box collider attached to them. The bunny already has some basic scripts to allow it to jump when the space key is pressed, and I have added animations for this jumping effect on the bunny.

Learning the new development environment has been really interesting. A UI elements feel similar to that of Visual Studio, such as the properties window in Visual Studio is similar to that of the Inspector pane in Unity. Having the tutorials to walk me through each step has allowed me to understand where each aspect is. The fact that the videos don't exaclty match up to the environment itself to me actually makes it very helpful because I have to solve the problem of understand the element that is being worked on at the point. Once again, understand the core concepts as with version control and the command line seem more important that getting to worried about the specifics of the interface.

I have throughly enjoyed the first week of development. Jumping into a new set of tools and having higher levels of understanding git has given me confidence that no matter the types of challange that I will face over the semester, they will be met with a degree of slowness, stillness and learning.
