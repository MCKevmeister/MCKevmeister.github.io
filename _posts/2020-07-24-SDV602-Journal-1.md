## Hello SDV602!!!

This will be the blog that I will use to document my learning and understanding for this course.

I am going to be following a tutorial first called [BunnyRun Tutorial](http://rabidgremlin.com/runbunnyrun/).

First, I have installed the most recent version of [unity](https://unity.com/). Unity first opens into what is called the "unity hub". It acts as the home screen for unity projects, like that of microsoft word, visio or excel.

## Setting up the environment

Since my laptop does not have a lot of system resources, I have adjusted the primary code editor from Visual Studio to VS code. To accomidate the development in unity, I have installed a few extensions in VS code as per the [documentation](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/other/unity).

The first few videos in the series, I have started to become familiar with the user interface that unity offers. The different windows can be moved around as needed in the development envorinment. This mimics other IDE's that show different interfaces. Sometimes the hierchary will be important, other times the different views of the current scene might be needed to gain perspective on the development environment.

## Version Control

Following the 4th video in the series, I have established source control using Github. The repository for this code is available [here](https://github.com/MCKevmeister/BunnyRunTutorial).

I am already somewhat comfortable with using Github desktop as a git client. What is interesting to note, is that the GUI has changed since the time of the original videos. This highlights the fact that it might be better to learn the console commands associated with git as the GUI is subject to change.

# Unity Editor

At the time of writing, I have completed 4 1/2 videos of the [Run Bunny Run](http://www.rabidgremlin.com/runbunnyrun) series. The above screenshot shows the unity editor. The scene I am working on has a few sprites (the bunny and cactus) as well as the ground asset. All these elements have a rigid body and box collider attached to them. The bunny already has some basic scripts to allow it to jump when the space key is pressed, and I have added animations for this jumping effect on the bunny.

Learning the new development environment has been interesting. A UI element feel like that of Visual Studio, such as the properties window in Visual Studio is like that of the Inspector pane in Unity. Having the tutorials to walk me through each step has allowed me to understand where each aspect is. The fact that the videos do not exaclty match up to the environment itself to me makes it very helpful because I must solve the problem of understand the element that is being worked on at the point. Once again, understanding the core concepts as with version control and the command line seem more important that worrying about the specifics of the interface.

I have throughly enjoyed the first week of development. Jumping into a new set of tools and having higher levels of understanding of Git has given me confidence that no matter the types of challenge that I will face over the semester.
