## Fundamental Storyline

For this class I will be focusing on learning C# and the UML associated with the development of a C# application. I am not taking it to learn how to tell stories, make games or learning graphical art techniqes that unity uses.

First off, I want to make it clear, that I am not an author or writer of any great distinction. I feel that I might struggle with this class due to the large amount of storywriting and graphical editing that is needed. I was assuming that this class was going to be about coding (being a software development class) so I feel a bit confused.

The game that I am intending to develop will be a puzzle game of sorts. The player would have to solve a series of puzzles that lead them through a linear set of rooms. Each one would have only one way to solve it. There would be interactable elements in each room that would have some way of helping the player solve the puzzle.

Each one would have only one way to solve it. There would be interactable elements in each room that would have some way of helping the player solve the puzzle.

I am unsure as to how I will start the game. I guess that I will just somehow start the player in the room as if they just woke up. They would have to interact with the room elements. For example, the first room might have a key on a dresser that the player needs to pick up. For the first milestone using text-based input that would look something typing `pick up key` into the console. The player would then be able to type something like `display inventory` and their inventory contents would be displayed to the console. They could then type `unlock door with key` or `use key on locked door` and the door would be unlocked. Typing `open door` would then change the scenes and the character would be in a new room. From this new room they would have to figure out where to go next. The first few rooms would introduce the concepts of the game. Progressively the game would get harder.

To help the player and to make the game multiplayer, in each room the players would be able to chat with other players are also in that room through a chat. This would allow them to collaborate and to try and solve the problem together with other players. When the player left the room, they would see only the chat messages of the new room and not the previous one.

There would also be introduced concepts possibly through notes that might be written down that the players could read describing the room or game mechanics. If the player got truly stuck, they could simply type `help` to receive a set of instructions on how to help them through the game. There could be another command like `help â€“a` to get a full set of instructions as to how to finish the game if they were to get stuck.

Due to how little resources I have on my BYOD device as required by this course, I will not be making anything that has large graphics. The run bunny run game is struggling to run on my computer. So I will have to make a minimial GUI when I come to develping that. Also, I'm not really artistically gifted, so I intend to use free assets from the unity store as needed.
