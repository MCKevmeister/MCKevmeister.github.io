Per chance I was playing around in the settings of unity and came across the android APK settings. I choose to download it to my phone and opened the apk from the folder the I moved it into.

What loads next, well its the exact game you have been working on in unity. Neat. The only thing that wasn't in the already programmed game was the title screen, some of the logic and the sensor input.

Short though, an additional daily thought or journal if you will.
