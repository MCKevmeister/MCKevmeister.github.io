# Network Vulnerabilities



## Network foot priting 
tools to discover network vulnerabilities through:

## Packet Sniffing

In the lab, you use Nmap to scan the network and Wireshark to capture packets on the network.

What information can you obtain by network footprinting using Nmap?

How could an attacker use this information?

    How can packet sniffing be used to detect potential threats on a network?
    Analyse the packet capture and assess what is happening
