## The Video Series

I cannot fault the creator of this video series. It was great for the time when it was made. My comments in this blog refer to the tutalige for NMIT since this was a prescribed activity.

While the tutorial might be great if you are using the same version of unity that are in the tutorial videos, its clear to see how differnt the version of unity I am using is in comparison.

I found it incredily difficult and annoying to using the unity editor. My assumption is that it is due to how different the UI in the video is from the current UI of unity. Due to this, it is not intutive and feels very cumbersome.

A major problem I had was in creating a new scene, some of my scripts stopped working on the old scene, then when I went and re-added the scripts to the game objects they didn't update in the scene that I was making them in, only the new scene. This occured after I had changed the scene, and was working in the new scene. There is no visual indication that is obvious quickly what scene I was in.

No matter what I did, the scripts would not work in the old scene anymore. In the end I had to delete and delete all of the grass game objects that where not responding to the recycler script.

I tested and everything worked from one scene, but my GPU was struggling with the rendering and the console in unity was registering 999+ errors. It is unclear as to where my mistakes are as I literally have to guess at points what the differences in the different UI's are, and often make guesses as to functionality of the unity editor.

It's not difficult to do the work when I know what I am doing but using 4 year old tutorials makes it a challange.

The GUI of github desktop has also changed since the release of this video series.

I am at least comfortable with github and github desktop so I could understand what was happening for the version control.

The video tutorial is fine but dated. While the core concepts are there, to learn them at the same time as translating what you are learning into the modern perspective with the tools that I am working with (the current version of unity).

We have not really recieved any tutilage in class yet. Since all we have been doing is writing stories and figuring out the "elements of a console based text game"???? I'm not sure what this means for my project work in this class. I am very concerned about where this class is going.

I want to learn industry relevent skills. Currently on seek there are only 11 jobs listed when searching "unity" in the Information and Communication category, compared to ".NET" which has 530 listed jobs, or "python" which has 425 listed.

It seems like there is a lot to learn and very little reward offered once learned. I want to ["Become work ready"](https://www.nmit.ac.nz/news-article/show/become-work-ready) (Become Work Ready,2020). It seems like NMIT is teaching me skills which are not in demand on the job market.
