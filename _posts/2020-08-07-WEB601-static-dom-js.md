This class was just watching a youtube video series. We dind't recieve tutatlige on this as its basic static DOM work with Javascript. The finalized code for the website can be found [here](https://github.com/iamshaunjp/JavaScript-DOM-Tutorial/tree/lesson-18). Not quite sure where the class is going as we are suposeded to have made wireframes and storyboards for our websites already, and created a draft app for our project, and moved into working with ExpressJS, testing routes, http methods, deployment and writing basic test scripts. Why this hasn't happened yet I'm not quite sure. The couse is diverging far from the couse outline that I am not sure what we are doing anymore.

I've reached out to the business that I wanted to base the website that I wanted to build. She has allowed me to use the images and other assets from her website, but is not interested otherwise in engaging as a stakeholder so far.

I intented to make a set of simulated stakeholders and will reach out to the other stakeholders as I identify who they are.
