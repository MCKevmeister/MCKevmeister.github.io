This class was watching a youtube video series. It builds a basic static Document Object Model (DOM) built with HTML with Javascript included. The finalized code for the website can be found [here](https://github.com/iamshaunjp/JavaScript-DOM-Tutorial/tree/lesson-18).

I've reached out to the business that I wanted to base the website that I wanted to build. She has allowed me to use the images and other assets from her website, but is not interested otherwise in engaging as a stakeholder so far.

I intented to make a set of simulated stakeholders and will reach out to the other stakeholders as I identify who they are.
