Due to the "practice labs" environment not working for me at all I have had to do my own research on the CVE databases.

## Investigate and discuss one of the more severe vulnerabilities found as a result of the OpenVAS scan. Depending on the vulnerability the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) database may be of use

As somewhat of a layperson, I'm not sure how much extra detial I can add to what is already a very through and indepth field of study on a single vulnerability. Notalby all of the most recent vulnerabilities require super detialed understanding of systems to a very fine detail. The takeaway that I have form this is that security is an overly complex subject that would require single focus and a team of professionals to understand.

The [CVE website](https://www.cvedetails.com) seems to follow in line with this observation. While it lists many vulerabilities, understanding what each vulerability is, is beyond me. Yes there are vulnerabilities, do I understand in detail what each vulnerability is no, can I understand the concept of what the vulnerability is, sure.

In researching the website to find a sutable (read simple enough for a simplton like me) vulerability, I note that it seems the website is no longer kept up to date. Sometime around mid to late 2019 whoever was running the website decided to no longer keep it up to date. I have searched out an alternative that is kept upto date, and found [https://nvd.nist.gov/](https://nvd.nist.gov/) which is reccomended by security professionals as an alternative.

Filtering by recent, I can see that there is a vulnerability that effects Hueiwei mate 30 phones with the CVE number [CVE-2020-9243](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-9243). The vulnerability allows for the phone to suffer a Denial of service error from executing recursive code on itself. The vulnerability is only possible if an attacker is able to trick the user to install a malicious application onto their phone.

Huawei has since fixed the vulerability in their codebase and their offical security advisory can be found [here](https://www.huawei.com/en/psirt/security-advisories/huawei-sa-20200805-03-smartphone-en).

## Investigate and discuss vulnerability assessment of services on Cloud Infrastructure such as Amazon Web Services

A simple search using the NIST database of CVE reveals that there are 107 vulnerabilities that have been identified, some as recent as the [11 August 2020](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-8912). While some of these vulernability have a low impact and can be easily patched, it highlights the fact that all services no matter how big or well developed the security systems that they may have in place, are suspetiable to vulnerabilites. In fact, by being so large they are in a sense "to big to fail". Due to the large amount of service, products, and vendors that amazon provides they are more likely to be attacked as the impact of exploiting a vulnerability is likely to be much higher. A malicious actor would have potentially more to gain from disrupting or interfering with amazon's systmes, and if able to, extract more from the assets that amazon has.

Due to this, amazon is quick to respond to the vulnerabilities that have been identified. To ensure their customers, Amazon maintains an active [secuirty blog](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/) and regulary posts [security builtens](https://aws.amazon.com/security/security-bulletins/?card-body.sort-by=item.additionalFields.bulletinDateSort&card-body.sort-order=desc&awsf.bulletins-year=*all).
