## Struggling with practice Labs

First off I want to reiterate how crap practice labs is. Without being able to see the full screen, I am unable to tell at points what I am supposed to be doing. Additionally, the input lag makes it so painful to use that I'll do something but over correct for the lag, thereby acidentially clicking on something that does something unexpected. Its bloody terrible to work with VM's over an internet connection when they have not been optimized for working over an internet connection. The UI of practice lab's literaly gets a 0/10. Also, the insturctions not clear. "Click the first thing" which is acutally the 5th thing. Some steps literally are just to show you a screen, but its unclear as to why I had to go the screen, or what is displayed on that screen. Oh, theres a whole bunch of numbers shown here. Great, none of this means anything to me. Somone at practice labs need to learn that "less is more".

Anyway, the lab or something...

I went to a tab on a thing, then seemingly based on the instucitons went to the actual tab that I was suposed to go to??? The screen tearing didn't help trying to find my way around the lab environment. Eventually after doing nothing for a few steps, I accidently clicked on the instuctions and it closed the lab environment.....

I literally cannot. From here on out I'm just reading the instuctions and will blog about the questions as proposed in class, as the "practice labs" environment is genuinly hostile towards me.

5 minutes later, I'm now struggling with the practice labs instuctions that keep resetting and reverting me back to the main menu. I'm not lieing, this software is literally hostile towards me. I'm fighting this stupid thing to just read the instuctions of what I cannot do due.... Well done practice labs, your DRM is making your website impossible to use.

## Investigate and discuss one of the more severe vulnerabilities found as a result of the OpenVAS scan. Depending on the vulnerability the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) database may be of use.

## Investigate and discuss vulnerability assessment of services on Cloud Infrastructure such as Amazon Web Services.
