Xamarin is incredibly useful in creating cross platform applicaitons. To aid in the development of this, the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) archictctural design pattern is used.

MVVM is used for implementing User Interfaces (UI). It is composed of 3 ideas.

- Model (resuable code)
- View (platform-specific code)
- ViewModel (reusable code)

Only code the model and ViewModel once for several different platforms. Platform specific code only needs to be made for the view.

## View

What the user sees, in Xamarin these are called page's.
The view inlcudes only the UI elements. It does not inlcude any logic that might be attached to those UI elements. For example the view might inlcude a button that accepts user input. The view would include all the code for what happens visual changes of the button when it is pressed, but does not include any logic for what the button does such as submitting values of a form to another part of an application.

## ViewModel

Logic, whats going to happen to that applicaiton to give the expected result

## Model

Data, clases, abscraction of the problem. How the data is showen and how the data is abstracted from the problem

## What is data binding?

Happens between the UI and the logic of the app. In the UI ther will be a dependency object that has a dependency property.

In the logic, there is an object with a property.

We want to bind these together.

1. One-way data binding
2. Two-way data binding
3. One-way to Source
