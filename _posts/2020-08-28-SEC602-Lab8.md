## Public Key Infastructure

Public Key Infastructure (PKI) is a systematic approch to infomraiton security. Instead of individual parties develping there own security measures to sucure data and mitigate risks, PKI provies a simple yet very secure system for information security. It exands upon the concept called "the web of trust" which was coined by PGP inventor Phill Zimmerman. The Concept of the web of trust is that each user in the web acts a signatory for others that they trust. To send a message to a user that you don't know you need to traverse the web till you find the node of that user.

The downsides of the web of trust are that its decentralized approach makes it difficult to manage. Additionally, there is a high barrier of entry for new users and requires a high level of technical knowledge.

To overcome the shortfalls of the web of trust, central authorities have been estabilished as the Infastructure of the PKI model. These central authorities are known as Certificate Authoraites. Instead of relying on peer to peer turst relationships, the PKI relies on the trust of the certificate authorities.

Certificate Authorities verify the identity of individuals or organizations and issue them certificates stating that they are who they say they are. The process is simiar to that of gaining a passport, which requries multiple forms of identitification including a birth certicate and proof of address. Each additional document adds weight to the proof of who you say you are. Once verified, the issued passport acts as a validation of identity and in turn can become a validation docuemnt unto itself for 3rd parties. If the 3rd party trusts the passport issuer and validity of the passport then they should trust that you are who you say you are.

Similarly in the PKI model, different certificate authorities will issue certificates based on varying credentials such as ownership of a domain name, or physical proof of identity. If the Certificate Authority is satisified that you are who you claim to be, then the CA will reqest your public key, encrypt their certificate with your public key and send you the encrypted message over a secure channel. You can then decrypt the message with your private key and use the certificate. When you need to validate your identity with others, you simply give them the digitally signed certificate and that user or organization can check the signature against the Certificate authority.

PKI works through a set of public and private key pairs. The public key can be made available for anyone to send information to a party through. The private key is used by that party to decrpt the message that is sent to them.
