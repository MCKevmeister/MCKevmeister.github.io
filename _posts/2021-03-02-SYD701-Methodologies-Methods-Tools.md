## Systems Development Methodologies

The introduction to the Systems Development Methodologies class was an interesting one. After COVID, getting used to members of the class not being present was familar. However, to have most of the class attending via a Teams call was ... interesting. I did quite enjoy having to help with some of the more technical parts of the class such as ensuring that Lars remained in frame for my fellow classmates and transcribing his lesson plan and other writings on the board into the teams chat as they were illegible on the video. This did make the class that extra bit enjoyable.

This weeks posting is on the levels of systems development. From what I could gather from what Lars was saying, he believes that there is a tierd way in which learning takes place in the 3 classes tought at NMIT, which parallels with the complexity and higher level concepts of each of the 3 levels.

### Tools

At the bottom level, equivalent of the first year of the Bachelor of Information technology level 5, we learn about and use tools. Tools allow us to do something in a particular way. They are often well tested and proven to be effective in the task that they perform. Sometimes there are several tools for the same job, sometimes it requires many tools to complete a task. Often times, to complete a complex task it requires several tools used in a certain combination in order to complete. Tools range in all different shapes and sizes, some tangible and some intangible. The tools that were specifically taught in the first year of the bachelor included information gathering techniques such as interviewing, questionnaires, direct observations, use of case studies, and diagramming techniques among many others. 

While knowledge of how a specific tool works can be important, what becomes apparent is knowing how to apply the use of that tool to solve a problem. Even with specific knowledge of a tool as it currently is, ignores the fact that some tools change and adjust over time (specifically software tools). As such, it remains paramount that the craftsman using the tool is proficient in the overall craft of what they are doing so that when changes occur, they can adjust their learned skillset to either adapt the new tool to their current toolset, learn another tool to replace the old one, or discard the tool entirely. What is important is to remain flexible and to not rely solely on 1 specific tool.

### Methods

The next layer above tools, equivalent to the second year of systems development study is the layer of Methods. Methods are a way of doing things. Methods incorporate the knowledge and use of tools to achieve a task or solve a problem.
As time passes methods can change and adjust. Methods that were once in the popular zeitgeist become outdated and irrelevant as new methods become more efficient or effective at completing tasks. Naturally as more ways of using a collection of tools are trailed, the best rise to the top and become common place and standardized.


### Mehodlogy
#### (Did you mean Methodology Lars?)

Assuming the latter (spell check is a great tool), I will provide a few definitions below.

Avison and Fitzgerald give the following definition

"A collection of procedures, techniques, tools and documentation aids which will help the systems developers in their efforts to implement a new information system. A methodology will consist of phases, themselves consisting of  sub-phases, which will guid the systems developers in their choice of the techniques that might be appropriate at each stage of the project and also help them plan, manage, control and evaluate information systems projects" (Avison & Fitzgerald, 1995, p. 10)

This definition is specific to 'information systems' however the concepts in general apply to systems overall. Monologies generally follow a philosophy or way of thinking about doing something. They are made of a collection of methods and tools. Methodologies tend to have a set of assumptions surrounding them regarding the systems that they apply to, be it documentation, working software/product, ability to change and adapt etc.

Methodologies are the general higher-level concepts, the philosophies of why we are solving a problem a certain way. They are a systematic approch to developing a system, working in or with a system. Methodologies tend integrate the human (I very much like the quote from Dr. Kelly Starett "your body is a complex "system of systems" (Dale, 2020) so read human as system if you will) into another system holistically.

Methodologies tend to have structure and frameworks of which there are detailed ways of doing things. For example, in Object-orientated systems view things as objects with state and behaviours.

## Different types of systems

The idea that systems can only be information technology (IT) based is limited. The more I think about it the more I think that almost anything can be viewed as a system (or at least part of a system).

Some systems are simpler than others for example a chair has 4 legs, a back and a seat, but together these parts work to solve a problem and serve a purpose for people, a place to sit. They can be designed in different ways (made of wood, made of metal, made with caster wheels on the feet, with more the 4 legs, with less than 4 legs etc). The complexity of some systems lies in the subtle differences between them.

Below follows 2 lists, one of IT systems and one of non-IT systems as examples of the complexities that can exist in systems.

### IT Systems

* Car parking management system
* Online Banking system
* Windows 10
* Mac
* Linux
* GitHub
* Git
* Google
* Internet
* Facebook

### Non-IT Systems

* Solar System
* Electrical System
* Nervous System
* Plumbing system
* Digestive System
* Number Systems
* London system (popular chess open as white)
* Lymphatic System
* Weather System
* The environment around you right now

I really could make both lists very long, however for brevity I shall keep them short, not only for my sanity but for you dear reader.

## What I can do in terms of systems development

This to me seems broad and rather vague, but I believe that is the intent of the question. My academic experience is that of the classes SYD501 and SYD601 at NMIT, during which time I have worked with Unified Modelling Language (UML) and diagramming techniques (data flow diagrams, process maps, interaction diagrams, decision trees etc). I feel that this is only just touching the surface into these areas and as it is only academic, I do wonder about the practicality of what I have learned in the real world.

I am interested to learn about Agile and Dev-ops, a lot because they have become somewhat buzz words in the world of software development, and I would like to be able to talk with some confidence about them with fellow developers or future employers. I am also aware that the tutor for Systems Development Methodologies might have a slight bias towards these and it would be prudent to invest time and effort into what the tutor would be excited to teach, to make it more enjoyable for both the tutor and myself as a learner.
