## Self-Emergent Systems

The class today initially discussed self-emergent systems, as well as the idea from Daniel Pink of Autonomy Mastery and Purpose from his book Drive. The theme connecting these 2 ideas is of course self-emergent systems.

One of the class videos showed and demonstrated how self-emergent systems in traffic flow produce higher flow of traffic though an intersection.

Located in Swinden England, the Magic Roundabout is a great example of self-emergent systems. The roundabout is not a single roundabout, but rather 5 roundabouts surrounding a central roundabout that goes the wrong way. By following the basic road rules (give way to the right/left and indicate, as well as looking at other drivers in the eyes to see if you can understand thier intention), a commuter is able to easily navigate towards their intended destination. The following videos show how the roundabout works, and how self-emergent behaviour solves the problem of several roads intersecting with one another.

Expanding on this, the following video looks at specifically how the different ways that a commuter could choose to navigate through the 'magic roundabout' given differing traffic volume conditions (0:30 - 0:57).

## Problems, Puzzles and Messes

### Puzzle

> "A puzzle is a set of circumstances in which there is no ambiguity whatsoever once some thought has been given to what is happening or needs to be done. The issues that need to be faced are entirely clear, the
range of options is completely known and there exists a single correct solution to the puzzle". 
(Pidd, 2013)

When approaching this blog post in general, I was drawn to this part specifically, and while out of order from the original context, I felt it best to start with. While other people in the class instantly identified a puzzle as a jigsaw puzzle, I identified a puzzle with chess.

Chess puzzles are where there is one move or a series of moves that lead to a position of advantage, or a win. Chess puzzles often involve tactics such as discovered attacks, pins, skewers, or forks. Puzzles are used to improve one's skill. In times gone by puzzles would be issued in books or news papers next to crosswords. Nowadays, puzzles are spotted by computers and can be solved on websites like lichess.org. Advantage nowadays is calculated by chess engines, the strongest and widely used open-source engine being Stockfish.

In the puzzle above, white can play Ne7+ a very forcing move, checking the black king and attacking the black queen (known as a fork). Black must play Rxe7 capturing the knight with the rook to get out of check without losing the queen. This allows Qxe7, the white queen recapturing the rook, and gaining advantage in the position.

I feel like this is a great way to understand a puzzle. It has a clear set up, the rules of the system are well defined, and the outcome has a very clear way to be achieved.

### Problem

>"A problem is more complicated than a puzzle, but less complicated than a mess. This complication stems from the fact that a problem has no single answer that is definitely known to be correct. At the heart of a problem is an issue that must be tackled." (Pidd, 2013)

I quite liked one of the points that one of my fellow classmates raised about a problem. His example was if your car had broken down. In that instance, there are several different ways to solve the problem, call a mechanic, try to fix it yourself, buy a new car etc. The solution to a problem really is unclear and needs to be defined by an entity interacting with the system that has a vested position. In the case of the car, it is likely that the car costs an amount of money, and likely that to solve the issue might cost either money or time. It could be beneficial to do a fast cost-benefit analysis on the side of the road, and if the problem cannot be resolved quickly a slower cost-benefit analysis once more information about possible solutions could be gathered.


### Mess

>"A mess is a set of circumstances in which there is extreme ambiguity and in which there may well be disagreement ... In a mess there is a whole range of possible definitions and descriptions of what is going on, and there may be no way of knowing whether a solution, as such, exists at all." (Pidd, 2013)

When trying to come up with an example of a mess, I struggled to think of anything beyond the video of the 3/11 Japan Tsunami.

The fact that a large part of Japan ended up being destroyed, the lack of ability of the people in the video to stop what was happening from happening, the fear and uncertainty about what to do to protect themselves and others ... All of it to me screams MESS. While the mess was eventually cleaned up (apart from the continued nuclear disaster at Fukushima) the impact that it had on all areas of life in Japan and the world were almost incalculable.

In the book Tools for thinking, Michael Pidd simplified Problems, Puzzles and Messes into the following diagram and I think it does incredibly well in defining simply what each is. All have a formulation and a Solution; however, those formulations and solutions are sometimes agreed and sometimes arguable.
