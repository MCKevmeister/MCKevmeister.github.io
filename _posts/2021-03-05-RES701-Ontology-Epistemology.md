The class today involved a discusson of the following questions.

1. Is there adifference between ‘knowing’ something and ‘having knowledge’ of something?
2. What is ‘truth’?
3. What do we really mean when we say something is ‘true’?
4. Is there a difference between knowing something is ‘true’ and believing that something is ‘true’?
5. What is the difference between subjective and objective ‘truth’?
6. What is a ‘fact’ and can ‘facts’ change?
7. How do we discover if something is ‘true’ or not?
8. “We do not see things as they are but as we are” Anais Nin. What does this mean?
9.  “Reality is an illusion, albeit a very persistent one” (Einstein) What does this mean?
10. Is there a difference between ‘true’ and ‘valid’? Explain!

Some of the questions had simpler answers, others seemed to cause a fair amount of discussion between the members of the class, other seemed entierly unanswerable. I feel that there is no better quote to descirbe what occured during those moments than the quote from St. Augustine "What then is time? If no one asks me, I know what it is. If I wish to explain it to him who asks, I do not know."

It was pointed out that the real crux to answering these questions gets to Ontology and Epistemology, which I must admit are words that I have heard spoken before but have not researched. So I shall set out to understand their meaning.

## What is ontology? How is it relevant to research?

The very simple answer to this question can be described as "What is reality?". Answering the quetion, kinda hard. But asking it - Ontology. 

The longer answer, well its a bit more complex. Ontology is a branch of meta-physics or philisophy that studies reality or what there is. There are 2 major positions of ontology; realism and nominalism which contrast one another.

In realism, a reasearher sees the world as spearted from the interperations that humans have of it, or being independent of the mind. In Nominalism a researcher sees the world through their interperations and subjectiveity. 

I am going to be totally honest, I think most of the answers that I could find are entierly rediclious and as such I haven't listed them. There really isn't a great way to answer the question, nor is it really an interesting area of study in my opnion, mostly because I could say that something is and therefore to my ontology it is because it is because it is. Honeslty, it seems a tad rediclious. Circular logic to prove the something is seems entierly flawed, based soley on belif that it is, therefore making it "reality" to the observer is insanity. As an extreme example, I could identify as a flying rainbow rhinosorous and if you don't acknoledge me as such you should be punished by death from the winged unicorn of saturn. If I believe it, how is it not ontologically correct?
While I think that there is some value in letting the mind ponder on theroetical questoins, I do not think that in the world of information technology where things are measuarble and definable through the measurement of 0's and 1's is useful at all. It does seem to serve a purpose in trying to encapsulate the etheral, for example emotions and interpersonal relationships. Now, I do admit that I have a bias towards the former probabley due to due to my interest in computer science and computing in general, as well as a non nurtured emotional connectivity.

I think that knowing that there are different ways in which people can view the world can be useful to understand how they precieve the world. It seems like there is some benefit to this in initial research, at least in knowing that the reasearcher has an ontology (even if I might not agree with it). Being aweare of any particualar bias when conducting research for myself then allows me to acknoledge the areas of ignorance.

So to answer the question, "how is ontology relevant to reasearch?", I'm going to assume the question is asked of my reasearch. As such, since I think the general concept of research being mostly a for-profit model now (see my previous blog post), I don't ontology will be relevent to my reasearch at all, as I never want to engage in that type of reasearch.

That is not to say that I will not follow the scientific model of asking questions, formulating hypothesis and setting out to disprove those hypothesis as strongly as possible. I just cannot understand how in that process asking the question "What is real?" will help to produce a workable answer that will be of benefit. However, I do hope that I can be dispoven, as is the scientific mindset. Hopefully I can be shown how ontology is relevent.

## What is epistemology? How is it relevant to research?

Again, simply as I have diven my self crazy trying to find any definition that makes sense simply it is "How can I know reality?" and agian the answer of which is highly theoritcal and not really realevent to any research that I want to conduct.

## What is the connection between ontology and epistemology in a research context?

Philosiphers believe that first you have to answer the question of ontology then the question of Epistemology, and seemingly there is a right and wrong way to answer these questions (how by the way?) to a accidemic review board. If such an acidemic review board where to reject my ontology, I would ask them how they know, to which any answer is not enough.

Seems like forcing students into classes that they have to take to get a degree might not be the best idea when the area of study that they want to do is not philosiphy but rather computer science or information technology. I don't get either of these concepts due to how theoritcal they are and non applicable in the real world they become. They are both highly contentcious to me and having to write about them is kinda annyoing. I now really doubt the ability for me to graduate if I must provide an ontology and epistemology that isn't both the "flying purple moster".
