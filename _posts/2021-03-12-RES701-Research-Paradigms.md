## Unanswerable theoretical Philosophy

This class is turning into pure philosophy and should probably be renamed research philosophy not research methods. I don’t want to be taking a philosophy class, I am taking this class only as a "research methods" class. The only discussion that is occurring is in and around philosophy, which normally I might not mind but in this case, I do since:

* I have no choice not to take it if I want to graduate from Te Pūkenga (I’m not graduating at NMIT since it won’t exist in 2022)
* I must pay $1000 for this class

Undoubtably, Lars is knowledgeable on the subject, I just do not see how practically this is relevant to the study of Information Technology and "research methods" (apologies Lars). No link has been made between philosophy and research, just that it is and therefore it is. On the same token I could say that it is not, and therefore as well it is not.

As such I don’t really want to carry on, but NMIT (not Te Pūkenga) has forced my hand, since I cannot withdraw from the class(beyond the 3 week withdrawal period of getting a refund and a lack of other subjects to study in place of this class).

Below is the table that was drawn up on the board. I don’t fall into any of the camps as previously stated, they are too limited and don’t bare any relevance to the subject of “research methods” to me, but rather "discussion around the unanswerable questions of the philosophy of research". If I was to search for an answer to a question (research, per chance?), a search engine doesn't first ask me "what is real?" or "what do you know?" it just gives me a series of links to documents that might provide the answer. It doesn't require that I undertake and ethics review board submission, academic review board submission. NO. That would be insane. Research in that sense is then conducted based upon the answers found and the tests that are conducted to prove or disprove their truth. If I cannot find provably backed evidence of an answer, then I look at another search engine, or read a book.

This whole idea of philosophical methodologies reminds me of a veritasium video that I rewatched recently, regarding how no one has measured the speed of light.. It sounds a bit insane initially, but every measurement of the speed of light is not the speed of light in one direction but rather the 2-way speed of light or round trip speed of light. It's a tad complex, but simply every measurement of the speed of light is done by bouncing a laser (or other light producing device) off of a mirror and measuring the time it takes for the light to return to source. Known time, known distance, some math..... speed of light. However, these measurements are of the 2-way speed of light not 1 way. As Derek argues in the video, there simply is no way to disprove the speed of light (c) might not be c/2 in one direction and infinitely fast in the other. I'd encourage you to watch the video as it is thought provoking.

Anyway, the way he ends the video to me gets to the ideas that have been coming up in this class. "When is 'right now' on Mars?" As of now, there is no way to answer that, because there isn't a provable way to answer it. Of that I can agree. When it comes to answering, "What is your epistemology and ontology?" I see no difference. There is no evidence based provable way of answering. Until there is an experiment that can prove this, such questions are sure worth answering but mean very little in terms of what they are trying to accomplish, academic value and credit. Beliefs and "truths" are nothing without the tests and methods to back them up. So, for now, I'll be naive, and fail a bachelor’s degree based on being unable to provide an epistemology or ontology for any research that I conduct.
