## SCRUM

Below is a presentation that my group gave in the class on the SCRUM methodology. SCRUM is an agile methodology and as such shares many similarities with the agile methodology. The idea behind scrum is that there are small groups of people working together on a complex software development task. The development is broken down into "sprints" which last around a month, with weekly sprints inside the month, and daily sprints in the weekly sprint. A sprint is defined by the goals the scrum master wants the sprint to achieve by the end. These goals come from the "product backlog" which is the features that the product owner wants to incorporate into the final product. The scrum master works with the product owner to decide on the task that shall be completed in
the next large sprint.

## My Favourite Development Methodology

My "favourite" development methodology is hard to define, due to the fact that I have not worked within a production environment in any methodology. I would only base my choice on the industry trends that I have observed: Agile, Dev-Ops and SCRUM being the top in most job listings and industry blog posts of the last couple of years. As all these development methodologies share many characteristics, I think adopting and learning one of these would be practical.
