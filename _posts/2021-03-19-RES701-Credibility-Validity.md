### CS50 Harvard Lecture

I found the video by following these logical steps

1. Went to www.youtube.com
2. Searched for "Computation Thinking" in the youtube search input
3. The 5th video was the above video

The video was created by Harvard University's Computer Science department. The video was posted to youtube on 16 September 2019. It seems that it was recorded slightly earlier in that year, possibly nearer the begnning of the year, however it is hard to tell. If I was to analyse the video fully though, there may be clues to the exact date that it was filmed.

I think that this is highly credible due to the fact that for that the course "CS50" has been run for several years.
