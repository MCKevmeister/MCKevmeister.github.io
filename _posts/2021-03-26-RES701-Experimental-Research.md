For this blog, I made a presentation for the class on Experimental Research. The scope of the presentation was limited to the following questions:

* What is it? (Short description of how it works)
* What kinds of questions/problems might it be useful for?
* How could it be used in IT research (try to think of an example)?
* What are the strengths of the approach?
* What are the weaknesses of the approach?

## What is Experimental Research?

Experimental research is when a experimenter manipulates a variable known as the independent variable, and measures the changes that occur on another variable known as the independent variable. The results that are produced from experimental research are Quantitative.

## Example from IT

An example from IT is A/B split testing, where from a number of visitors to a website some are shown one variant and others are shown another. Based on what the experimenters are trying to encourage the visitor to do (click a button, order a product, time spent on page etc) the page will be changed and modified towards the result that proves the highest benefit.

A/B testing is also run-on email advertising campaigns where click throughs are the best metric. The same thing can be done on YouTube videos with differing titles and images to advertise videos.

The variables that can be changed include:

* Different colour of buttons
* Layouts and shifting components on a page around
* Text on the page
* Price points of products
* Different Images

A real-world example is that of a banner that was located on Humera's landing page. Humera is an American health insurance company. The goal of the banner was for people to click through to see the sales page for health insurance with Humera.

The initial banner had several faults including:

* Too much text that is difficult to read briefly
* No clear "call to action"
* No clear message

There were several rounds of tests where the image, text, call-to-action, and colors where all changed. The resulting banner while similar to the original had a combined clickthrough rate of 832% from the original.

## Questions Experimental Research answers

Experimental research does well in a few specific areas which are understanding cause and effect relationships and how manipulation of a variable changes another.

## Strengths of Experimental Research

Experimenters have great level of control over variables in experimental research. Due to this level of control, experiments can be repeated several times with different independent variables. This allows more fine-tuned results.

The results that are produced are purely quantitative, and due to the control of the variables should be highly reproducible to achieve the same results by other researcher with the same experiment design.

## Weaknesses of Experimental Research

In some cases, manipulation of the Independent variables can lead to situations that wouldn't be possible for the environment being tested. If such a case happened, it would make the data gathered pointless.

Due to tight controls on variables, running experimental research can incur high cost and can run a long time to produce data that is significant.

As with all experimentation, if people in the experiment know that they are being observed then their actions may differ from what they would have normally done.

The experimenter might also have a certain bias towards a specific result and as such might have an impact on the variables either knowingly or unknowingly.
