## What are Root definitions

To understand a complex system that is not defined, a system analyst can use a technique from the soft systems methodology call root defintions. Root defintions are a definition of all the parts of the system from a particlar view of the system. This view is normally from the perspective of a user of the system. By looking at the system from the perspective of each user, the system analyist can greater understand what the system must do to meet the needs of each user and reconcile the differences of needs of all users into a finalized set of needs for a system. This reconsiliation is an attempt to gain perspective, rather than just understanding a system from the perspective of the user group who the system analyst is interacting with (likely the client who will be the system owner).

The root definition has 6 charaistics and the structure of each definition follows: who (**A**ctor) is doing what (**T**ransformation) for whom (**C**lient), and to whom are they answerable (**O**wner), what assumptions(**W**orld View) are being made, and in what environment (**E**nvironment) is this happening. A consice way of denoting this is though the anagram CATWOE.
