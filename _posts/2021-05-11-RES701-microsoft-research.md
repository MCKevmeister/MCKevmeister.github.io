Today’s class was the first back from the semester break. To replace Lars who has left to work in Austria, NMIT have employed a temporary tutor for 4 weeks, Nick Burns. He discussed his background and his involvement in the IT industry.

The class was a bit of a catch up. We covered what different sources of research were and how they would be rated in terms of formality. This ranges from sources like blogs to Peer reviewed journals. Blogs are mostly informal and not highly credible but do provide the basis for continued deeper research to find primary sources. Where as Peer Reviewed Journals provide the highest quality of validity and credibility due to the work being reviewed by other researchers before being published as well as being published by a publisher who has their own credibility to uphold. Other sources tend to fall somewhere in between these 2 and knowing how to try to find primary sources is important to getting to credible research that can be referenced.

Peer reviewed journals still do have problems even though they are the most credible. These include the replication crisis that I have previously blogged about, the need for the researchers to gain grants so therefore try to prove something extreme, and the fact that only new or interesting research is published rather than replication or follow up studies. When reading through research on peer reviewd journals, it is important to keep these sort comings in mind.

## Microsoft Research

As assignment 2 is due in this weekend, we are looking to a specific case study of research published by Microsoft. It was posted on their blog, and concerns how remote work effects the fatigue levels of people in meetings, and how features of Microsoft teams could be used to ease that fatigue, such as something called “together mode” and “dynamic view” which display the participants in a call more normally by using AI, rather than just separated by grid lines.
The main findings of the research done were that brain wave patterns showed a lack of concentration after 30 minutes into a call. These measurements where achieved by monitoring 12 people though the use of EEG and heat rate monitoring.

I find it hard to think that this research is valid or believable for a few reasons

* The study only included 12 people, a very small n for a study
* Does not spcify the method of collection of data, how many people where in the study, the control, or any details about the study
* Lacks a link to the full study paper
* Shows a limited data set that while colorful, doesn’t have any sort of reference or comparison values

The data provided is just a simple line graph saying that brainwaves of participants changed over time. Microsoft goes on to make the bold claim that due to their analysis they recommend regular breaks and limiting meetings to 30 minutes. While these claims follow common sense, the data that they provided is very very weak to support their claims. Without correctly citing the source of the study they conducted it is impossible for anyone to read through the study and find how the data was gathered. On the extreme side of things it could be that Microsoft has cherry picked the data to report on in order to support their claims.

While Microsoft is an international company, without providing a source for their data, it seems to me like they are just trying to produce what looks like scientific data in order to sell more of their products, particularly that of Microsoft Teams and Office 365. If they were able to produce the data or the study, then I may be more likely to think that the piece was believable, however still I would question it. Where the participants of the study paid? Where the researchers employed by Microsoft? Would that create a conflict of interest? Did Microsoft test other products that could do remote work such as Zoom or Skype? Could it be possible that the data from the study only shows positive results due to that being what Microsoft wants to show about their products.

I think that without providing the source of the study for the article, the piece ends up smelling a bit like a sales page for Microsoft products rather than scientific reporting. The fact that also no other 3rd party has reported on this without using the exact copy from the article is also a bit suspicious.
