### What do I think ‘research’ is?

Notably, after the first research class, I would ponder on the capitalization on 'research'. I was unaware of big 'r' research and little 'r' research. As such, I will provide answers as to what I think both mean without doing my own 'research' but will endeavour to "research" to gain a greater understanding of them for the future. For this blog though, all the questions that have been asked of "me" will be answered without conducting 'research' as I believe the intent of the questions are to get 'me' to think. Where the questions do not ask of me, I will conduct 'research' to assist in formulating an answer.

To me, little r 'research' means quickly searching for information or data using a simple search method to find some specific information about a topic, question, or problem. For example, recently I needed to find out how to reset the maintenance counter on an electric garage door. I searched online for the manual and found the key combination to enter. There was not any in-depth analysis needed of the information I was looking for but rather I just found what I needed to know.

Big r "research" seems like it is the more formalized Research. The type of studies that are entered into scientific journals, that involve a lot of money and tightly controlled tests to uncover something that was previously unknown to humankind or to prove/disprove already published data. This type of research takes time and effort, and as such money.

### Do I think I will ever need research skills?

As I have previously mentioned, yes, it seems somewhat pointless to ask the question as I have undoubtably used research before and will do for most of my larger life choices that I have yet to make.

Also, in my time studying at NMIT I have used research for most of my projects that I have completed. The work that I have undertaken is in fields and areas that I have not previously studied and have therefore had to learn through textbooks, online journals, blogs, online tutorials, and other sources.

Moreover, research has become invaluable for me in solving everyday problems. I am unsure of anyone who when struck with an issue would not perform research to solve the problem. The tools may have changed slightly as the world has move more online, however the same basic concept of general research still exists. When people of the internet age have an issue, they turn to search engines such as google, duckduckgo, Wikipedia or other sources. When I was growing up, I was lucky that my parent’s purchased encyclopaedias and I would thumb through them when I was bored at home to look at the interesting pictures and read about different topics. They became more useful as I grew older and needed to do primary and intermediate schoolwork as my reading became more tightly focused.

### What do I think a research journal is and who is it written for?

Research journals are organized places for formalized 'Research' to be published. They normally have an area of focus, be it a specific science or area of study. Some that come to mind are the following

* Nature
* Science
* JAMA - The Journal of the American Medical Association
* The Lancet
* Pub-Med

To have one's work published in such a journal would be quite the honour, however it seems nowadays that journals act more for profit than they do for the promotion of science. Most journals will provide abstracts of the studies that they publish in them for the public to read, however, to read the full text, then an individual must find a paid copy of the journal to access the full text of the study.

Additionally, new discoveries are heavily favoured by journals as discovering something new can sell more copies of a journal than can republishing a study that supports the findings of a previous study. As such I am aware that the amount of repeat studies is dropping and without finding the exact study (aka I am still not doing "research" yet) from memory there was a study done on the amount of repeat research being done being far less than 50%.

I knew that I had heard about it and after a bit of searching online the term that I was trying to remember is known as the "reproducibility crisis". Scientists that have followed up on previously published works have been unable to replicate the results of the work done. The journal Nature asked 1576 scientists to reproduce the works of their peers and over 70% of them were unable to do so (Baker, 2016). Additionally, John Ioannids investigated the reasons as to why in his work "Why most Published Research Findings are False" (Ioannidis, 2005). He claims several different reasons as to the bold title of his work which include bias, small study sizes, poor analysis of data gathered, financial bias and how in-vogue or popular the area of study is.

Notably, there have been efforts made to democratize the information that journals try to keep behind a paywall. The website call Sci-Hub was created to circumvent the barriers to accessing the published works, which are often funded by government agencies and provides access to PDF versions of full papers where possible.

Knowing that most researchers are just glad that people are interested in their work, and that they gain very little money from the publishers ... I mean journals when people read their work, I will gladly continue to circumvent paywalls as much as  I can to produce the best work that I can. I also am aware that it is the responsibility of the copyright holder to enforce their copyrights when they have been broken, not the work of an organization such as NMIT to punish their students when they 'research' in ways that they would prefer did not occur. However, all of this could just be hypothetical. 

So, to answer the question, yes, I know what a journal is. However, I am not sure that they are beneficial for society overall. That is not to say that they are poor but that scientists are incentivised to publish new and ground-breaking work over credible and reproduceable work. It almost seems as though they have become somewhat of a glossy magazine that those that subscribe to the journals exorbitant rates can read through for fun.

### What is plagiarism?

Finally, a question not directly asked of me, therefore ‘research’ shall commence!

A quick search indicates that there is a great resource on plagiarism, plagiarism.org.

“According to the Merriam-Webster online dictionary, to "plagiarize" means:

* to steal and pass off (the ideas or words of another) as one's own
* to use (another's production) without crediting the source
* to commit literary theft
* to present as new and original an idea or product derived from an existing source” (Plagiarism.org, 2017)

This definition provided there, which is originally from Miriam-Webster dictionary seems to define it concisely.

An example of plagiarism would be if I were to pass of that definition as my own. Instead, if I reference the work and cite the source (of which NMIT requires APA7), then I acknowledge the creator of the work, and that I am only adding my own thought on to that work afterwards.

Note, I am not exactly sure if the way that I have sourced and cited would still be considered plagiarism. I would hope that it is seen as not, rather that I prefer to defer to those that know when I do not. 


### Why is it important to avoid it? 

Plagiarism is important to avoid so that I can ethically say that the work that I have submitted is my own. I cannot with a clear conscience submit work that I have not created and claim that it is mine, due to the down stream ramifications of doing so. For my schoolwork, that would be in breach of the student charter and/or the copyright policy and/or the academic integrity policy’s that NMIT have and as a student I must follow. By breaching these documents, I risk the penalty of , and I could be in risk of suspension or expulsion from NMIT.

So plagiarism is a serious matter, and this student pledges to follow the guidelines that NMIT sets. Where needed citations will be provided through works using the American Psychological Association 7th edition style guide (Bradley et al., 2020). An example of APA7 can be seen through out this document and in the references list that follows ...
