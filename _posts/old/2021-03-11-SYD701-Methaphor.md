I had written this blog, then microsoft word decided no I hadn't written it making me have to rewrite the whole thing. This blog isn't going to go into the detial that I had in my first, but that is possibly for the better.

The class discussion revolved around several different questions about metaphor and computers. The biggest takeaway from the discussion was that most terminology from the world of computing uses metaphor. The only examples that we could come up with as a class were the words “compact disk” as the storage medium that had been created for computers. 

I had proposed that the word “compute” was a computer term that was not a metaphor, but lars correctly pointed out that before “computers” the electronic device there were people who had the job description of “computer” and the role of “computing” or in the present tense “to compute”. Their job was to preform long mathematical calculations by hand on paper.

Since most of what computers are doing at the lowest levels is done in binary, there is a need for abstraction to simplify what it is that is computers are doing. While we could discuss computing between humans in binary, it would take a very long time and to discuss complex ideas it would almost be impossible. Abstraction is necessary to convey ideas quickly, which is not only relevant to the world of computers but for survival and prospering in the world more
general.

If I talk about saving a file for example, there isn’t a literal paper file of some sort that is being archived, but the concept of putting a file in a cabinet and tabulating its location to an index of some form is in part what is occurring in computer systems. The high level concept is what is important, the implementation details might vary from system to system. Understanding how those implementation details vary is unimportant to the user of the system, they just want to have access to a file when they need it.

Metaphor is critical when communicating very conceptual ideas with non-technical users of systems, which for a developer or system analyst could be a business customer. They do not understand low level conceptual ideas of computing, they have their own domain knowledge. By using a set of metaphor’s that transcends both domains of the client and developer, a skilled systems analysis is able to do several things

* Better capture the requirements of the system
* Better implement what the client is wanting
* Communicate clearer when technical issues occur
* Fix problems and find workable solutions when problems happen

Humans have a natural ability to lay story onto situations. I think that it is necessary to use this alongside of metaphor when communicating highly conceptual ideas to non-technical people of whatever domain in order to transfer ideas.

Writers often use the phrase “show don’t tell”, meaning you don’t want to tell someone what is happening in a scene but rather describe all the details so that they can build a vivid picture in their head of the scene. In this sense, I think that it is critical that we “show” the concepts through the use of metaphor and storytelling rather than “tell” the details.
