For this blog I am posting a set of 3 links on the subjects of "computational thinking" and "Virtualization Technology". For each of the links posted I will be answering the following quesitons on the link:

* URL, e.g. http://
* Search terms used
* How I found it?
* Who wrote/created it?
* When it was written/created/recorded/published?
* What kind of ‘publication’ it is (e.g. news item, YouTube video, white paper)
* How ‘credible (believable)’ you think it is – include your reasons

## Computational Thinking

### CS50 Harvard Lecture

Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjqgP9dpD1k

I found this video by following these logical steps

1.  Went to www.youtube.com
2.  Searched for "Computation Thinking" in the YouTube search input
3.  The 5th video was the above video

The video was created by Harvard University's Computer Science department. The video was posted to YouTube on 16 September 2019. It seems that it was recorded slightly earlier in that year, possibly nearer the beginning of the year, however it is hard to tell. If I was to analyse the video fully though, there may be clues to the exact date that it was filmed.

I think that this is highly credible since the course "CS50" has been run for many years. As well, the students of Harvard (and the wider community of the class online) are basing the work in the course on the reputation of Harvard university, one of the most credible universities in America (possibly the highest). The cost of admission of the Harvard courses is also into the thousands of dollars so the staff of the course are financially vested to producing quality credible work. As well, the course and videos of the whole CS50 course are uploaded twice a year, as the recorded semester is made available online under open source licence.

### AlphaGo - The Movie \| Full Documentary

Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXuK6gekU1Y

While on YouTube after finding the first video, I saw this link in the sidebar where the movie listed. I was watching videos on chess engines and was aware of the deep mind project on creating an engine that beat the best players and bots in the world at chess and then Go. Not only was this 'research' for this class but also it was rather entertaining.

The documentary follows the creation of the AI of alpha go created by deep mind. While not specifically about Computational thinking, I feel that Artificial Intelligence is very much an extrapolation of computational thinking.

I did not use any search terms but used the sidebar feature that was available on YouTube. I assume that it showed me that video based on my previous search terms to try and increase my watch time.

The documentary was produced by moxie pictures. It was filmed over 2015 and 2016 during the time that deep mind played several strong players of go.

The documentary itself is quite entertaining but not reliable as a source of research. It is more of a dramatization of the events that occurred in a documentary format. It is useful for a layman understanding of the project but not a valid source of research for follow up research. It is obvious that this did occur and is entirely believable. This is not to discredit the work of deep mind though as the work they are doing with AI is exceptional and arguably the best in the world right now.

I found this quote in the documentary to be quite profound.

>   "at least in a broad sense move 37 begat move 78 begat a new attitude in Lee
>   Sedol, a new way of seeing the game. He improved through this machine. His
>   humanness was expanded after playing this inanimate creation and the hope is
>   that (alpha go) and the technology in behind it can have the same effect
>   with all of us"

### Mastering the Game of Go without Human Knowledge

Link:
https://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/id/eprint/10045895/1/agz_unformatted_nature.pdf

On searching up on Wikipedia to find more information about the alpha go documentary, I came across a citation to the above document. It details the way in which alpha go and deep mind changed the way that they trained alpha go. 
I did not need to use any search terms to find the publication, again it was done via searching inside web pages that I was already browsing. Although, that is searching, just not in the way that was obviously intended.

It was published by 17 employees of deep mind in the journal Nature in October 2017\. The publication was an article that included data sets and metrics that deep mind had produced from both playing different versions of alpha go against itself.

I feel very confident in the credibility of the research that deep mind has done. My only concern is that since the source code of alpha go is closed, it is hard to verify the validity of the engine. However, from all the data that is available it seems that Alpha Go has effectively "beaten" the game of go, at least until another equally strong or stronger AI comes along. Unless google releases the code of alpha go, the credibility of the research is valid in the expert break down of the games that it plays. As no human is now able to beat the AI, it makes it impossible to disprove. As the paper goes on to explain that the way alpha go got so strong was by playing itself without using any supervision from human's, I think it starts to move beyond the world of the disprovable.

## Virtualization Technology

### Intel virtualization technology

Link: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/1430631

Seeing as all the previous links were following the same idea, I decided to change the approach in finding articles. To find this link I followed these steps:

1.  Went to https://scholar.google.com
2.  Searched for "Virtualization Technology"
3.  Clicked on the first link listed

It was written by 10 employees of the Intel Corporation who are a mix of engineers and technologists. It was published by the Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers in "Computer" May 2005.

It is a peer-reviewed article to meeting the publishing requirements to be printed in "Computer".

I think that it would be a credible article due to the reviewers that must be independent of the article. The publication has more at stake in terms of reputation loss by publishing a poor article than it would be accepting it. Due to it also being published by one of the industry leaders in hardware, I think that Intel would also have a lot to lose in terms of commercial reputation if
the article wasn't fully credible.

### VMWare - What is virtualization?

Link: https://www.vmware.com/solutions/virtualization.html

Following the logic of choosing different methods to find articles the I took the following steps to find this article:

1.  Went to qwant.com
2.  Searched for "virtualization technology"
3.  It was the first result

The article which is informative only was written by VMware. There is no date of publication on the website and as it is informative only, I would speculate that they would update the page with regularity.

Curiously, I did the searched same thing on duckduckgo and google and both had this as the first link. I think that this shows that the several search engines think that it as valid information due to its high search ranking.

VMware are producers of production level virtualization products and therefore they would want to inform their customers of the products and services that they are selling. If VMware posted information on their website, I would imagine that it would be highly credible due to the risk to their brand in the case that it wasn't. I would search externally for non-biased sources of information though if I was considering using VMware products, as it is unlikely that VMware would post anything critical on their own website about their products.

### Red Hat - What is Virtualization?

Link: https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/virtualization/what-is-virtualization

Again, seeking alternative ways to find information I followed these steps to find the link:

1.  Went to www.searx.ir a (current mirror of searx)
2.  Searched for "Virtualization Technology"
3.  It was the second link

The informative article was written by Red Hat, the industrial producer of virtualization technology. There was no listed date of publication.

The article explains what virtualization is and how it works at a high level.

As with the VMware article, this source is also a commercial entity producing the information. It does not have the credibility that an independent article would have. However, it would not serve the business goals of informing their customers and encouraging them that Red Hat is competent and professional if they provided non-credible information on the website. For this reason, I think that the information is likely to be credible, however I would search again for non-biased sources if I wanted to be certain.
