For the second assignemnt in the Systems Methodologies Class we had to report on a Failed system development.

## Introduction

The failed project that I am reporting on is the Novopay system developed for the Ministry of Education in New Zealand by Tallent2. 

In 2005, the New Zealand Government started modernizing the payroll processing of the Ministry of Education. The incumbent model provided by Datacom was called DataPay. It used a paper form-based system whereby schools filled out paper forms for a payroll run and sent them into the Datacom service center where an assigned pay clerk for each school manually entered the data into the computer system. 

The system was out of date for a few reasons

* The cost of employing central pay clerks and other staff members to process the pay runs
* The lack of an automated system for larger schools to quickly process pays
* The problem that some of the software in the system was nearing the end of support

The government agreed in 2007 to seek an outsourced payroll system, which aimed to lower costs, transfer risk away from the Ministry of education, and required less ongoing resources to maintain the system.

The Ministry submitted a request for a proposal. Four vendors responded, including Talent2 and the incumbent provider Datacom. The Ministry selected Tallent2 as the preferred provider to deliver the new software solution. Talent2 signed the contract on the recommendation of Minister of Education Trevor Mallard to produce the new payroll system called Novopay.

## PRINCE 2 Methodology

The project management methodology chosen for the Novopay project was PRINCE2 (Projects in Controlled Environments). The reason it was chosen was that the ministry required this as dictated by the State Services Commission documentation “Guidelines for Managing and Monitoring Major IT Projects”. While the project implemented some of the PRINCE 2 methods, a lack one single overall project director lead to compounding issues. The PRINCE2 methodology requires certain roles for individuals. One of the roles specified a single project manager. However, there were several successive governments during the project. There were no single project manager as new governments put new ministers into different roles in cabinet, specifically the minister of education. This lead to ministers having different understandings of the project’s requirements and needs, each blaming each other for political reasons.

There was a project board that was created for the oversight and governance of the project. However, this board was unaware of the “Guidelines for Managing and Monitoring Major IT projects”, did not understand the PRINCE2 methodology, as well as not fully understand their role in the project. The size of this board was larger than the required size specified by the methodology. The larger size lead to many differing points of view and conflicting governance of the project. 

The PRINCE2 methodology also specifies the use of specific artefacts including an issue register, risk register and quality register. While some of these were kept current by Tallent2, not all were implemented or kept updated throughout the project.

## Misunderstood Business Case

The complexity of the payroll system was not fully understood by both the ministry and Tallent2. There were 85,000 people paid in each pay run, with over 100,000 people being paid each year. There were also 15 different collective agreements with teacher across the country. Due to the different places that some teach were teaching (part time, relieving, teaching at different schools) there were over 10,000 possible combinations of pay conditions. The system needed to provide 1 payslip per person per pay run. This was not fully understood when the RPF process was undertaken and lead to the misunderstanding of the business problem.

Added to that, each school had differing ways in which it allocated annual leave to teachers. When teachers took annual leave, it was almost impossible for the system to allocate that leave to a school if a teacher worked at different schools.

Datacom throughout the new system development continued the operation and maintenance of Datapay. During renegotiations of the delays in the contract between Talent2 and the government, datacom extended their contract and offered to provide a contingency if the Novopay system was not ready for roll out. The Government did not choose to take this up, even when Tallent2 had to renegotiate the contract twice, which included changing the requirements and allowing for extensions to the data of delivery.

## Training

Before the system when “live”, as part of the contract Tallent2 was to provide training materials for the individual schools to learn how to us the system. This was provided initially as an online only 85-minute course that covered general pay issues. This too had problems as schools had a hard time signing people up to learn the Novopay system online.

Even then, some schools had limited access to the internet and did not have users with enough technical skill to fully understand how to interact with the computer system. They had previously used only paper forms and now had to learn how to use a computer system, from an online course on a computer. A failure here was assuming basic computer competency rather than offering in person training to allow non-technical users a more human front to the hard, confusing, and confronting computer system.

The training that was provided as well only covered typical pay scenarios and did not include any difficult or confusing situations such as a teacher working at 2 or more schools. For these problems, Tallent2 provided a service center phone line so that schools could call and receive help with problems. This was different than the previous model that Datacom provided where a specific pay clerk was appointed to each school. When there were issues, the school would interact with this clerk who would know the details of the school and likely had interacted with the payroll staff before. The training also failed to reach all the schools, of which 13% of schools received no training at all.

## Survey

Several months before the “go live” was enacted, when the Novopay system would become operational, a readiness survey was sent to all 2457 schools. Only 699 schools responded to the survey. The survey had a simple question which was “I am ready for Novopay” and asked the schools to rate their own readiness. The results are below.

At a board meeting the following week the results where discussed. A had been previously set at no more than 10% of respondents strongly disagreeing, or else the readiness would not be considered “green”, and a go-ahead would not be signed off for the “go-live”. It seems ridiculous that only just over 28% of schools responded, and that over 15% of respondents indicated that they strongly disagreed with the readiness statement, yet all board members supported the go live decision. 

## Service Centres

Datapay under Datacom had 3 different service centres. Each service center had developed its own understanding of the business problem due to the schools that it interacted with. There was not 1 overall business process but rather 3 individual and separated understanding of the business process of running the payrolls. Each center had developed its own procedures for dealing with the schools that it managed. This caused an impossible task to centralize and consolidate the business processes together, especially when individual schools had a dependency on this interaction with the old service centres with the staff that handled the requests. As identified in the ministerial report, there was not enough effort made to consolidate these changes during requirements gathering phase of the Novopay project.

The new service centres were quickly inundated with calls from the schools that were having problems. If schools were unable to get adequate help from the help line, they processed their pay runs via paper forms rather than the online forms. I would assume that this is because they were more used to this style of payroll processing and could understand it better. However, this only made the problem at the service center worse as now it was receiving lots of phone call and lots of paper forms to process. Tallent2 had to quickly fix the problem by hiring staff, but they first needed to be trained in both the payroll system and processing the paper forms. This again was an oversight of the amount of problems that would likely occur when such a complex system was implemented and could have been abated if from the beginning Tallent2 had employed a larger number of these support staff.

## Testing

Testing was undertaken during the building of the Novopay system. However, due to having to increase the complexity of the system from the misunderstanding of the business problem, tests were initially delayed. Tallent2 subcontracted Assurity, a testing agency to assist them with the testing problems. Assurity found many issues with the testing protocol that was occurring including no clear or integrated testing approch and tests that did not produce replicable results. Assurity developed a testing protocol that was improved, so much so that the ministry of education employed the services of the agency to assist them directly with their user acceptance tests. However, in these tests limited schools and end users where involved.

With the Ministry needing confirmation of the go live date, the development and specifically the testing processes where under time pressure. At a critical decision point before the go live, there where 102 defects identified as well as many testing processes that were yet to be completed. The scope of the testing was reduced to meet the deadlines of the project.

At 4 weeks out before the go live,  a code freeze was scheduled. However, there were still 197 defects. This did not meet the go live contractual conditions, and fixes to bugs where continued to be released to the code base on up to the go live.
 

## Summary

In this project there were a confluence of errors, some big some small that in total produced a failed system that took several years after release and millions of dollars to rectify. These errors as I have pointed out included

* Not following the practices of the chosen methodology, PRINCE2
* Misunderstanding of the business problem. The payroll system that was being replaced was very complex with many human dependencies.
* Insufficient and inadequate training delivered in a format that did not meet the needs of the end users
* Poor gathering of user requirements and feedback to support changes necessary in the development of a complex system
* Service centres that were not capable of aiding all the schools effectively.
* Procedures rushed or not finished leading to problems that had to be pushed further and further back rather than being solved early.
