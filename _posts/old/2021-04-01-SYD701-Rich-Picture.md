A Rich picture is a graphical way to explain a system. It is used to on one page shows all the elements of the system that is being analysed. It takes a mess of an unknown and turns it into an understood simple page where all the elements of the system are captured, including all the conflicts and interactions.

For the rich picture of the Graffiti situation, I have extended beyond the application that is going to be developed. This is due to understanding the overall system that the application is going to fit into.

Below is an example of a rich picture that I have completed for the NMIT Scenario as outlined on the course blog.
