### The IT area/subject I have most enjoyed is

Systems Development and writing code that meets user requirements

### The IT area/subject I least enjoyed is 

The report writing classes and those with route memorization tests.

### The IT area/subject I was most interested in is 

The reason that I choose to study at NMIT was because I thought it was the best option that I had available to study software development.

### The one IT thing I never want to have to do again is 

Extreme amounts of written work and documentation that leads to no additional understanding or pratical tangible outcome.

### I chose to study IT because I  

Wanted to learn to code and get a job that would facilitate a career. 

### If I could not study IT I would study

I considered studying to become a functional medicine doctor, but I considered the fact that I did not have enough money to be a major reason to not take that route.

### When I was a kid, I wanted to be

Many different things: Chef, Pilot, Electrician amoung other ideas.

### One IT thing I would like to know more about is   

How use and understand large data sets to identify trends in human behaviour and biology to produce beneficial ways of living day-to-day
