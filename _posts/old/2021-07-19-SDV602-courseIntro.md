## Welcome to SDV602!

This will be the blog for the SDV602 class in which I will be learning python as a programming language. The course will be over 15 weeks and there will be a bit of interruption due to the inclusion of a non-contact week and some public holidays.

The class will focus around working on a data visualizer project. The elements of the project will include:

* Functioning in a terminal 
* Graphical User Interface
* Local Storage
* Network Services

## Setting up Development Environment

### IDE of Choice: PyCharm

As part of the [GitHub Student Developer Pack](https://education.github.com/pack/offers) we have access to the full JetBrains product range. This includes PyCharm and PyCharmEDU.

PyCharm is an IDE for development in python. It is very focused on keeping the developer on the keyboard and has ALOT of inbuilt keyboard commands. Inbuilt as well is autocompletion tools, as well as automated refactoringâ€™s to improve code quality.

Alternative IDE: VS Code with Python extensions. https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/python

I have set up both and intended to switch between the two so that I can gain experience with the language in different IDE's.

For the first class, I worked alongside Bob in the creation of the following PowerPoint. We were randomly chosen as the third responding group to email him and presented first.

This was the prepared slides that were created during the class. Bob and I gave a basic brief overview of the course materials that we have received so far.
