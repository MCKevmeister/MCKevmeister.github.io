## Purpose of Application

The purpose of the application will be to view and display covid-19 related data to a user, including data including:

* Current active cases
* Total Cases
  * Active
  * Recovered
  * Deceased
* Tests
* Vaccinations Administered
  * Type of vaccination
* etc *

*Applicaiton and purpose of the application is subject to change as and when the requirements of the software for the assignment are better defined and made concrete. If there are no updates to the requirements, then this is a working docuemnt and in no way represents the finalized product. 

The data will be able to be displayed in different formats such as by country/region, date/time, or filtering by highest/lowest number of a particular field. Data will be displayed not only in tables of numbers but also in graphs and charts to make it more intuitive to understand.

I have found [this]( https://github.com/owid/covid-19-data) data source. Im not sure if it fits the scope of the assignment, since the assignment is so loosely defined and will adjust as the assignment document is finalized.

## Brief Overview of the parts

* Graphical User Interfaces (GUI’s) for displaying data to the user in the form of graphs, charts, and numbers
* Data from external source, originally in CSV format
* Local database
* User Login and account creation
* Remote server/database using network connectivity
* Chat amongst users

## Toolkit

* [Python](https://www.python.org/)
* [Kivy](https://kivy.org/#home)
* [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/)
* Others that are yet to be defined

I am hoping that the course outline will detail the scope of the project with more fine details else be left needing to ask many questions to define and refine the software requirements, as they are not clear now.
