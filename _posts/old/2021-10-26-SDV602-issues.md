Tried for a long time to itterate through the data set that I had to build a list of all the countries. With a CSV file this was easy enough 

``` python
def get_countries():
    with open('owid-covid-data.csv', newline='') as csv_file:
        csv_reader = csv.reader(csv_file, delimiter=',')
        for row in csv_reader:
            if row[0] not in countries:
                countries.append(row[0])
```
However, when using a remote source, I was having to use a dataframe. Itteration throgh a dataframe the size of the data that I am going through takes far too long (I did it once, it took minutes). So a work around since this data set will never change is to just create a list of all the countries that I want to be able to display data for. For that I just copied the output of the above script to create a list in the program.

My once longer scripts for setting up all the data to work with are now reduced to a long list and a 1 line script. *long sigh*
