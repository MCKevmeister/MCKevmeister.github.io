For this assessment, I have provided design for the concept of the website that I will be
building for the charity. The charity will exchange tokens for food items, but also may exchange tokens for services in
the future. The parameters are quite vague, so I have taken the liberty of providing as much detail as I can throughout.

Included with the submission of this document is the subbed code for both a Express (OpenJS Foundation, 2017), Node (
Node.js Foundation, 2019), and MongoDb (MongoDB, 2019) implementation of the website, as well as a Laravel (Otwell,
2015), Vue (You, 2000), and Postgres (The PostgreSQL Global Development Group, 2019)  implementation of the website. I
am not sure if I will continue to use these choices for assessment 2, however they are what I have coded to date. I am
considering creating a Svelte (Svelte, n.d.)  front end for the Laravel backend.

I followed the document that was shared on the teams for the class as a template for the required sections. I had not
come across metaphor exploration before, but the book “Information Architecture for the World Wide Web”  (Morville,
n.d.) provided details about the ideas. I’m not sure that I personally find it useful for this project, as I am working
individually, however I do see some benefit to using it in a team and with an actual customer as it would allow the
exchange of ideas back and forward in more conceptual terms rather than technical details.

Personally, I am not comfortable with JavaScript, and find it to be difficult to read. The use of all the different
brackets ((), {}, []) seems inconsistent. Additionally, some lines seem to need semicolons, yet others do not and it
seems somewhat arbitrary. For this reason, I am considering doing my final assessment with Laravel.

I have found several useful guides for learning and understanding Laravel at the Laracasts website, one for building and
understanding the current version of the framework (Laracasts, n.d.-b), and one for building a full stack website with
an additional framework called inertia.js (Laracasts, n.d.-a). I find the way that inertia utilizes the backend to
manage routing to make more sense, as routing is closer to domain logic rather than being a concern of the front end. I
am sure that there are some pitfalls of this approach, but I find that it allows for a better separation of concerns.

I have enjoyed doing the evaluation of the website, and look forward to taking the requirements that I have gathered in
this evaluation and move into building out the functionality of the website in the coming assessments.
