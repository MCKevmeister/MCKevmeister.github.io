For this assignment, I worked with 2 stacks to evaluate them against each other. The stacks were:

* Laravel, Inertia, and Vue.js
* Laravel, Inertia, and Svelte.js

When I started this project, I was intending on working with the Vue stack for the final submission. This was due to the
larger community and range of additional libraries (Jetstream) that provide out-of-the-box authentication and
authorization. However, during the evaluation process, I found that Svelte was far simpler to work with. For this
reason, I made the decision overall to continue to work with Svelte for the final implementation of the website.

For the first time working with Svelte, I found that the REPL was very helpful. I was able to quickly learn about how
the code worked and often could search svelte and a search term to find an answer that would show how what I was looking
for was implemented in svelte.

Tailwind CSS was incredibly useful. It allowed me to quickly style the website without having to write any CSS. The
styles that I created for one website were easily able to be used in the other implementation. This allowed me to focus
more on understanding and evaluating the front-end frameworks without conflating that evaluation with styling.

Overall, the simplicity of Svelte was a huge factor in the decision to use it for the final implementation. I found that
the code was very readable and easy to understand. Additionally, I also found that the code was very concise and easy to
follow.

Working with Svelte made me come to enjoy working with JavaScript again. After being utterly confused after working with
React, and having similar confusion working with Vue, it was relived to find that Svelte just works as I would expect.
Declaring props as `export let prop` is what I would expect of other languages, but sadly the declaring of props often
requires defining the state of the prop. I can see that for more experienced developers, this may be a hindrance and
ultimately React may be better, but as a new developer, I find Svelte to be genuinely much more forgiving and explicit
in its error messages.

The documentation of Laravel, and Inertia are both incredibly in-depth and very helpful with examples throughout of how
to use the features of the framework/library. I am looking forward to building out the rest of the website with Laravel,
Inertia Svelte and Tailwind CSS.
