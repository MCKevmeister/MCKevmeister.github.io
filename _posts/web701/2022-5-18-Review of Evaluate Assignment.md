For this assignment, I worked with 2 stacks to evaluate them against each other. The stacks were:

* Laravel, Inertia, and Vue.js
* Laravel, Inertia, and Svelte.js

When I started this project, I was intending on working with the Vue stack for the final submission. This was due to the larger community and range of additional libraries (Jetstream) that provide out of the box authentication and authorization. However, during the evaluation process, I found that Svelte was far simpler to work with. For this reason, I made the decision overall to continue to work with Svelte for the final implementation of the website.

For the first time working with Svelte, I found that the REPL was very helpful. I was able to quickly learn about how the code worked, and often could search svelte and a search term to find an answer that would show how what I was looking for was implemented in svelte.

Tailwind CSS was incredibly useful. It allowed me to quickly style the website without having to write any CSS. The styles that I created for one website were easily able to be used in the other implementation. This allowed me to focus more on understanding and evaluating the front end frameworks without conflating that evaluation with styling.

Overall, the simplicity of Svelte was a huge factor in the decision to use it for the final implementation. I found that the code was very readable and easy to understand. Additionally, I also found that the code was very concise and easy to follow.

Working with Svelte made me come to enjoy working with JavaScript again. After being utterly confused after working with React, and having similar confusion working with Vue, it was reliving to find that Svelte just works as I would expect. Declaring props as `export let prop` is what I would expect of other languages, but sadly the declaring of props often requires defining the state of the prop. I can see that for more experienced developers, this may be a hindrance and ultimately React may be better, but as a new developer, I find Svelte to be genuinely much more forgiving and explicit in its error messages.

The documentation of Laravel, and Inertia are both incredibly in-depth and very helpful with examples throughout of how to use the features of the framework/library. I am looking forward to building out the rest of the website with Laravel, Inertia Svelte and Tailwind CSS.
