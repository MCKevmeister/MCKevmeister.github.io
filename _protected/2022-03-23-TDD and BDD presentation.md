This week I have a presentation on TDD and BDD as part of the Project course. I felt like it wasn't the best that I
could have done but still think it was good enough to cover the topic. I felt the feedback from the presentation was
that it was difficult to understand my project, and the benefit that it is delivering to SnapIT. As a majority of the
team at the moment are work and learning about TDD and which frameworks to use, as well as practices, I need to better
convey this in the rest of my work in the project.

Below is the presentation I made.
